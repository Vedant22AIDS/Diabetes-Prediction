This project is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on certain medical features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and others. Using machine learning techniques, the application can help users assess their diabetes risk by entering relevant health data.

Features
User-friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive HTML/CSS front-end where users can input their health data.
Machine Learning Model: A predictive model trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to classify whether a user is likely to have diabetes.
Real-time Predictions: Immediate feedback based on user inputs, providing the likelihood of diabetes risk.
Visualization: Graphical representation of important features affecting the prediction (optional, if applicable).
Responsive Design: The application is styled to work across different screen sizes and devices.
Technologies Used
Front-End: HTML5, CSS3 for the user interface.
Back-End: Python (Flask/Django) for serving the model.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy.
Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-app.git
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
Copy code
python app.py
Access the app at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
How to Use
Open the web app in your browser.
Enter the required health data, such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc.
Click the "Predict" button to get the prediction result.
The app will display whether the individual is likely to have diabetes based on the input data.
Future Improvements
Add more advanced visualizations for the prediction process.
Improve the model accuracy with additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
Allow users to upload health data files (e.g., CSV) for batch predictions.
